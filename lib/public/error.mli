(** A failure returned by SDK operations through [result]. Expected failures,
    such as an activity error, cancellation, timeout, or invalid payload, are
    represented by this type rather than exceptions. *)
type t

(** Constructs a structured error at an application-facing boundary. Most
    callers should prefer the more specific [codec] or [defect] helpers, but
    this constructor is useful to adapters and custom activity implementations
    that need to preserve a Temporal category. *)

(** Returns all publicly inspectable fields of an error. *)

(** Returns the lowercase category name, such as ["activity"] or ["codec"]. *)
val kind : t -> string

(** Returns the human-readable explanation of the failure. *)
val message : t -> string

(** Creates an error for a value that a custom codec could not encode or
    decode. *)
val codec : message:string -> t

(** Creates a non-retryable error for an SDK bug or a violation of an API
    requirement. *)
