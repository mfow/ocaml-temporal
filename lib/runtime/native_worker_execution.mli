(** Private worker-loop state for one OCaml-owned Temporal workflow worker.

    The functor below deliberately accepts already-decoded semantic protocol
    values. A native supervisor is responsible for decoding JSON, rejecting a
    malformed leased activation, and retiring that lease before returning its
    typed error. Keeping that responsibility below this module means this
    layer never guesses at a child/activity wire shape or silently drops a
    leased task. *)

module type SUPERVISOR = sig
  (** The opaque supervisor instance. Its implementation owns the native
      runtime/client/worker graph and serializes every operation on one owner
      Domain. *)
  type t

  (** Expected native-supervisor failure. The adapter copies only the stable
      code and message supplied by [error_code] and [error_message]; it never
      retains an exception or native pointer. *)
  type error

  (** The typed workflow poll operation. [None] means that the nonblocking
      poll observed no ready task; it is ordinary scheduler state. A returned
      [Error] must already have retired any leased activation that failed
      semantic decoding. *)
  val try_poll_workflow :
    t ->
    (Temporal_protocol.Workflow_protocol.activation option, error) result

      canonical validation and retires the exact native lease identified by
      [completion.run_id]. *)

      payload bytes, credentials, task tokens, and unbounded remote text. *)

(** Stable diagnostic exposed by this private worker loop. It is safe to log
    and intentionally excludes payload bytes and native handles. *)

(** Metadata observed after one activation has passed strict protocol
    translation. The callback receives no payloads, continuations, or native
    handles. It runs on the worker's serialized OCaml owner Domain, before
    workflow code is entered, so a diagnostic sink can prove replay without
    introducing an asynchronous cross-language callback. *)

(** One workflow definition registered with the worker. The existential
    wrapper preserves the input/output codec relationship while allowing one
    registry to contain heterogeneous workflow functions. *)

    workflow. They are aliases to the execution runtime and expose no
    continuation or native handle. *)

(** Returns all payloads carried by an update activation. *)
val update_input : update -> Temporal_base.Codec.payload list

(** One worker-loop outcome. [Rejected] means a valid lease was completed with
    a non-retryable bridge failure, so the caller can log the typed rejection
    and continue polling. A supervisor error remains a [result] error because
    the lease could not be proven retired. *)

module Make (Supervisor : SUPERVISOR) : sig
  (** A private owner-confined registry of running workflow executions. Calls
      to [poll] are serialized by an internal mutex so callers may safely
      invoke it from multiple ordinary Domains; workflow fibers must not call
      it directly because native supervisor operations are blocking
      producer-Domain calls. *)
  type t

  (** Creates a registry after validating every executable definition and
      rejecting duplicate Temporal workflow type names. [task_queue] is checked
      before the registry is published; empty, NUL-containing, oversized, or
      non-UTF-8 values return a typed configuration error instead of failing
      the first workflow activation. A valid queue is copied into every
      execution context so an activity without an explicit queue is sent back
      to the same queue as its workflow worker. No native operation is
      performed and no workflow function is called during creation. *)

      selected by its run ID, and submits exactly one completion. Empty native
      lanes return [Ok Not_ready]. Unknown run IDs and invalid initialization
      inputs are converted to typed non-retryable workflow failures and
      reported as [Ok (Rejected _)] after their lease is retired. Child-start
      commands and two-stage child start/result resolutions are translated to
      Core without allowing a completed child to remain leased. *)
  val poll : t -> (outcome, error_view) result

  (** Retries all completions whose native acknowledgement previously failed.
      The adapter mutex remains held while this operation runs, so no new
      activation can overtake an older lease. [Ok ()] proves that the pending
      map is empty. [Error _] leaves the exact completion in place. The caller
      must either retry it after an explicitly safe transient classification or
      force-retire the native graph and then call [discard] on a terminal path;
      it must never silently drop this completion while Rust still owns it. *)
  val drain : t -> (unit, error_view) result

  (** Discards all retained completion bytes and shuts down every OCaml-owned
      execution after terminal native cleanup. This is irreversible and must
      be called only after the supervisor has force-retired its native leases;
      it never attempts another completion. *)

end

(** Wraps a public workflow definition in the private existential registration
    used by [Make]. Remote definitions are accepted by this constructor so the
