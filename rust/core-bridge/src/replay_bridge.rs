//! Private replay-worker plumbing for deterministic history verification.
//!
//! The public OCaml API keeps this module private while the supervisor uses it
//! as the replay ownership boundary. Temporal Core owns replay state, Rust
//! owns the bounded history feeder, and no protobuf value crosses into OCaml.
//! Histories arrive as strict JSON with a canonical base64 protobuf body, so
//! the C/OCaml adapter can exchange a small auditable document without
//! importing Temporal's generated types.

// The Rust replay entry points remain private to the bridge crate. The OCaml
// supervisor reaches them only through the checked C ABI, which keeps Core
// handles, futures, and completion leases out of the public library surface.
