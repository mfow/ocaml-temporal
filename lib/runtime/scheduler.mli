val spawn : t -> (unit -> unit) -> unit

(** Runs queued fibers in order until none can continue. Returns the earliest

(** Runs the scheduler and returns a stable diagnostic label. *)

(** Permanently closes the scheduler and releases pending futures, paused
    fibers, and queued functions. Calling it more than once is safe. *)
val shutdown : t -> unit

(** Performs the private terminal control effect. The polymorphic result gives
    public terminal helpers a natural non-returning type. *)
