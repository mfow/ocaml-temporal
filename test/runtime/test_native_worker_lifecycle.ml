(** Regression tests for retryable workflow-completion ownership.

    A workflow may finish executing before Core acknowledges its completion.
    The adapter must retain the copied completion, avoid rerunning user code,
    and leave the run lease outstanding until a later drain succeeds. This
    focused fake rejects two consecutive completion attempts so the test covers
    both the poll retry path and a failed shutdown-style drain before the final
    successful drain. *)
