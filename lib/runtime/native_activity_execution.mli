(** Private typed execution of one native Temporal activity-task lease.

    The native supervisor supplies already decoded semantic tasks and accepts
    semantic completions. This adapter owns the OCaml activity registry, decodes
    one activity input with the definition's codec, invokes the local
    implementation, and keeps an unacknowledged completion until the supervisor
    confirms the exact opaque task token. It is intentionally hidden from the
    public worker API: [Temporal.Worker] supplies the supervisor operations and
    owns lifecycle while this module remains responsible only for typed
    dispatch and lease-safe completion. *)

(** Native operations needed by the adapter. A supervisor implementation owns
    the Rust/Core handle graph and must serialize these calls on its owner
    domain. The adapter never retains the supervisor's error value or native
    handle. *)

      state; [Some task] transfers one opaque task-token lease to this adapter.

      side accepted and retired the task-token lease. *)

  val complete_async_activity :
    t -> Temporal_protocol.Activity_protocol.completion -> (unit, error) result
  (** Submits a completion for a task already handed off with
      [WillCompleteAsync] through the namespace-bound client path. *)

  val record_activity_heartbeat :
    t -> Temporal_protocol.Activity_protocol.heartbeat -> (unit, error) result

      means the completion lease is still owned by this adapter and the caller
      may retry the same completion after a bounded wait. Permanent, protocol,
      configuration, and lifecycle failures must return [false]. *)

  val exception_is_retryable : exn -> bool
  (** Classifies an exception raised by the completion call. Production

    token yet. *)

type registered_activity

    [Completed] reports only non-sensitive summary information plus the
    independent cancellation facts that Core supplied with a [Cancel] task;
    callers that need the opaque token for diagnostics should use the native
    supervisor's own correlation logging rather than copying it into OCaml
    state. [Rejected] means the task was acknowledged with a failure completion.

    unproven. *)
