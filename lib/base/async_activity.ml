(** Correctness-first state machine for a retained asynchronous activity
    completion capability.

    The handle starts dormant because the callback may return a handle before
    the worker has accepted the [WillCompleteAsync] handoff. Every operation
    reserves a request key under [mutex], releases the lock while entering the
    supervisor, and commits the result under the lock. Consequently a second
    Domain cannot submit a conflicting terminal operation, while a transport
    failure leaves the exact operation available for a later retry. *)

    copied before they enter this type so retrying a transport failure can
    resubmit the exact request without retaining caller-owned mutable bytes. *)

  | Fail of Error.t
  | Cancel of Payload.t list

    retryability determines whether the pending operation remains available. *)
type submit_result = (unit, Error.t) result

(** The handle lifecycle is protected by [handle.mutex]. [Handoff_pending]
    closes the gap between a callback returning [Will_complete_async] and the
    worker accepting that handoff; [Terminal] prevents duplicate completion,
    while [Closed] permanently rejects operations after teardown. *)
