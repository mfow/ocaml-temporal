(** Deliberately fails the workflow with a typed, non-retryable application

    Core's full diagnostic text, which may include source and failure-info

(** Keeps a workflow execution open on a durable timer until the driver asks

    while the body remains replay-safe because it uses no wall clock, random
    value, I/O, or process-global state. Cancellation is converted by the
    native worker into a terminal [Cancel_workflow_execution] command before
    the timer fires. *)

(** Keeps one workflow run outstanding across a worker replacement. The timer
    is long enough for the controller to observe [TimerStarted] and stop the
    first worker before the server delivers [TimerFired]. Once the replacement
    worker replays the pending timer, the workflow schedules the deliberately
    transient activity with the bounded two-attempt policy. The final marker
    therefore proves both replay and a server-delivered retry on generation 2. *)

(** Keeps a workflow run in Core's sticky cache while a second run is
    admitted. The first workflow task schedules a non-eager readiness activity
    and parks on a false condition; the activity marker therefore proves that
    the initial task was accepted before the independent driver starts the
    second execution. The condition is replay-safe and does not add a command
    or history event, so this fixture keeps both runs open without introducing
    an unrelated timer replay boundary. The live eviction fixture configures
    the worker with one cache slot, so the second workflow task must then
    deliver a [RemoveFromCache(CacheFull)] activation for the older run. The
    driver observes that marker and cancels both exact executions. *)
