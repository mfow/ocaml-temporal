# Public API compatibility

`temporal-sdk` exposes one supported OCaml library: the wrapped `Temporal`
module. The implementation libraries, JSON protocol, supervisor, mailbox, and
C/Rust bridge are package-private and are not compatibility commitments for an
application. The installed-package boundary and its privacy rules are
documented in [the package-boundary reference](package-boundary.md).

## Current status

The package is experimental and has not reached `0.1.0`. There is therefore no
stable-version compatibility promise yet. Public signatures are nevertheless
treated as a deliberate contract: a breaking change must be intentional,
documented, and reflected in the checked-in consumer witness before it is
merged. Adding a new public value is normally compatible; removing a value,
changing a type, changing a labelled argument, changing a result/error
contract, or exposing an implementation module is a breaking change even when
the compiler can still build the repository itself.

The policy is intentionally conservative at the application boundary. It
protects the source API that a downstream OCaml program sees, not the private
Rust/Core implementation. The native bridge has its own version negotiation
and ABI tests; those do not make private modules or C symbols part of the
supported OCaml API.

## Installed-consumer witness

`test/fixtures/install-consumer/public_api.ml` is compiled as part of the
fresh installed consumer created by `make test-install`. Its explicit type
annotations cover the public definition, codec, future, workflow, interaction,
client, worker, and lifecycle operations. The file also aliases every module
listed by `lib/public/temporal.ml`, so a removed or accidentally hidden public
module fails compilation. The corresponding negative fixtures continue to
prove that package-private modules cannot be imported through a normal
`(libraries temporal-sdk)` dependency.

`test/bridge/test_install.sh` additionally compares the checked-in root's
module names with its expected allow-list. This catches an accidental export
even when no consumer happens to use the new name. The witness is a compile
check only: it does not contact Temporal Server, execute a workflow, or assert
runtime semantics already covered by the unit and live acceptance suites.

Run the focused gate with:

```sh
make test-api
```

`make test-api` is an alias for the installed-consumer regression, so it uses
the same package installation and private-artifact checks as `make test`. It
requires the normal Docker/OPAM build environment; it does not create a
second API-specific dependency set.

## Updating the contract

When a public API change is intentional:

1. update the affected interface and the typed witness together;
2. explain the source-compatibility and migration impact in the release notes
   for the eventual versioned release; and
3. update this document if the compatibility policy or public module allow-list
   changes.

Do not weaken an annotation merely to make a changed signature compile. If a
new capability requires a new public module, add it to the explicit root
allow-list and document why it belongs in the supported surface. Before the
first stable release, the maintainer will turn this policy into a versioned
compatibility promise and add the corresponding release-preflight checks.
