(** Regression tests for the private native worker lane scheduler.

    These tests use callbacks instead of a native worker so they can make the
    liveness boundary deterministic: one activity completion rejection is
    followed by a dedicated bounded retry backoff, then the exact same completion is
    accepted and the loop can observe a subsequent task. A permanent protocol
    error is kept fatal, proving that retry support cannot hide malformed or
    unsafe boundary data. *)

    inspect error contents. The [retryable] bit is produced by the adapter's
    explicit source classification, never inferred from message text. *)

    rejection. [closed] is set only after the retry succeeds so the test proves
    that the loop actually performed the retry before stopping. *)
