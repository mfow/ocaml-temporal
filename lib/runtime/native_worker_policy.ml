(** Pure lifecycle predicates for the private native worker.

    The pinned Temporal Core revision currently consumes activity completions
    and logs network failures internally. Consequently the only status that

    [Retryable] category; this module deliberately fails closed for every
    existing generic bridge status. *)

(** Flag effect of a re-entrant same-Domain [shutdown] admission failure.

    The [closed] stop flag is shared by [run] (its sole reader) and every
    concurrent [shutdown] caller. A [shutdown] issued from the run loop's own
    Domain must be rejected before it can wait on the run mutex (that would
    self-deadlock the calling loop), but it must not write [closed]: another
    Domain's [shutdown] may already have set it to request the loop stop, and
    any write here -- even echoing the observed value back after a racing
    read -- can undo that request and strand the loop. The action is therefore
    [Leave_unchanged]. Only [shutdown_retryable] is raised (the [bool]), so the
    public wrapper reopens admission and a later call from another Domain can
    perform the real drain-then-native-shutdown once the loop exits. *)

    observable to the caller through callbacks. The cleanup callback is
