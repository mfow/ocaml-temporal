(** Typed workflow signal definitions.

    A signal is a fire-and-forget message delivered to a running workflow. The
    definition owns the payload codec and the stable Temporal name; a handler
    can therefore decode the same bytes delivered by the local dispatcher or
    the native activation bridge. This module provides the typed definition
    and deterministic in-memory handler path. Native workflow signal delivery
    is available when the handler is attached with [Temporal.Worker.workflow].
    Native output-only query delivery and immediate one-input, non-suspending
    update delivery are provided by their respective modules; typed query
    inputs, suspended updates, and live query/update acceptance remain future
    milestones. *)

(** A validated signal name paired with the type of its input value. *)
type 'input definition

(** Public name for a signal definition. The separate alias keeps the nested
    handler signature readable without exposing representation fields. *)
type 'input t = 'input definition

(** Creates a signal definition. [name] must be non-empty, valid UTF-8,
    NUL-free, and no longer than the bridge's 65,536-byte identifier limit.
    Invalid names are programmer configuration defects and raise
    [Invalid_argument], just like workflow and activity definitions. *)
val define : name:string -> input:'input Codec.t -> 'input t

(** Returns the stable name used when registering and sending the signal. *)
val name : 'input t -> string

(** Returns the codec used to encode signal arguments. *)
val input : 'input t -> 'input Codec.t

(** A signal handler closes over ordinary workflow state and applies one
    decoded signal value. The callback's result is typed so an expected
    application failure does not escape as an exception. *)
module Handler : sig
  (** An existentially packaged handler whose input type remains paired with
      its definition and callback. *)
  type t

  (** Builds a handler for [signal]. Signal callbacks use the same direct style
      as workflow functions. The local dispatcher invokes them synchronously;
      native worker delivery invokes them on the owning workflow scheduler. *)
  val make : 'input definition -> ('input -> (unit, Error.t) result) -> t

  (** Convenience alias for [make] that reads naturally at registration sites. *)
  val handle : 'input definition -> ('input -> (unit, Error.t) result) -> t

  (** Returns the name used to index this handler in an interaction registry. *)
  val name : t -> string

  (** Decodes one payload and invokes the callback. This is primarily used by
      the package's deterministic dispatcher; exposing only this typed
      boundary keeps codec and callback ownership inside the handler. *)
  val dispatch : t -> Payload.t -> (unit, Error.t) result
