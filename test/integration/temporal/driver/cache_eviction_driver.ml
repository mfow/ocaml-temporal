(** Driver for the live sticky-cache eviction acceptance.

    The client starts two exact runs while the worker is configured with one
    Core cache slot. Each run schedules a long deterministic timer, so the
    first task reaches a durable pending boundary. Before admitting B, the
    driver waits for the worker's payload-free completion marker for A. This
    marker is written only after Core acknowledges A's initial activation, so
    the cache transition is synchronized without issuing a control-plane query
    that can wait on a separate poller during cache pressure. The driver then
    requires the worker's payload-free eviction marker. The second run's
    normal-completion marker is retained only as timeout diagnostics: pinned
    Core ordering buffers B until A's [RemoveFromCache(CacheFull)] activation
    has been acknowledged, so B is never evidence that eviction has happened.
    It cancels both exact runs and requires each to reach Temporal's typed
    cancellation outcome. The client never registers or executes workflow
    code. *)
