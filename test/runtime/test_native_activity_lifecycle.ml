(** Regression tests for retryable activity-completion ownership.

    Activity implementations may have irreversible side effects before the
    native completion call returns. The adapter therefore retains an owned
    completion keyed by the opaque task token and retries that completion, not
    the implementation. This test rejects two attempts to cover a failed poll
    retry and a failed drain before the eventual acknowledgement. *)
