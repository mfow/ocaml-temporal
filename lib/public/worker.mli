(** Worker registration and execution for OCaml workflow and activity code.

    Definitions are packed existentially only at the registration boundary;
    workflow bodies and activity bodies remain ordinary typed OCaml functions. *)

(** A heterogeneous workflow registration item. The existential package keeps
    each definition's input and output codecs paired with its implementation. *)
type registered_workflow

(** Packs a typed workflow definition for a worker registration list. *)
val workflow : ('input, 'output) Workflow.t -> registered_workflow

(** A heterogeneous activity registration item. *)
type registered_activity

(** Packs a typed activity definition for a worker registration list. *)
val activity : ('input, 'output) Activity.t -> registered_activity

(** An opaque worker instance owning one supervisor/backend graph and two
    deterministic registration maps. *)
type t

(** Creates and validates a worker. Duplicate names and remote-only definitions
    return typed defects before any backend graph is allocated. A [mock://]
    target selects the deterministic test backend; an [http://] or [https://]
    target creates the OCaml-owned native Core worker and its private Rust
    bridge. *)

(** Runs the workflow and activity poll loops until [shutdown] is requested.
    Each accepted task is decoded, dispatched to its registered OCaml function,
    encoded, and completed before the next task is admitted. This is a blocking
    call: invoke it from an ordinary dedicated Domain or system thread, not
    directly on a cooperative Eio/Lwt scheduler fiber. Native readiness waits
    release the OCaml runtime lock and return periodically so shutdown cannot
    be stranded, but releasing that lock does not make [run] non-blocking. *)
val run : t -> (unit, Error.t) result

(** Initiates graceful worker shutdown. Repeated calls are safe and idempotent;
    a native teardown error closes the worker permanently because the private
    supervisor has already linearized its terminal request. *)
val shutdown : t -> (unit, Error.t) result
