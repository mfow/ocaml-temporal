(** Deterministic local delivery of workflow interaction handlers.

    [Interaction] is the small, scheduler-independent part of the signals,
    queries, and updates API. It keeps typed handlers in immutable registries
    and routes encoded payloads by their Temporal names. The native activation
    protocol does not call this local dispatcher; the worker adapter owns native
    delivery and uses the same typed handler boundary. Keeping this module
    usable on its own gives tests and local tooling one precise ordering and
    validation contract. *)

(** Builds a dispatcher from handler lists.

    Every name must be unique within its interaction kind. The lists are
    copied into persistent maps, so later changes to a caller's list cannot
    alter dispatch. Registration errors are returned before a dispatcher is
    allocated. *)

(** Encodes [input], routes it to the matching signal handler, and preserves
    the callback's typed result. The handler is invoked synchronously in the
    current domain; native worker delivery uses the corresponding handler
    through the worker's scheduler-owned adapter instead. *)

    supplied definition. Query callbacks are expected to be read-only and
    non-suspending; this module does not silently make a blocking callback
    safe. *)
