    Keeping these predicates in the runtime library gives the retry and

    text and they do not own a native handle. *)

    explicit transient classification, not a guess based on the message. *)

val activity_completion_retryable :
  Temporal_core_bridge.Native_bridge.status -> bool
(** Returns [true] only for the bilateral retryable-completion status. Generic
    connection, readiness, worker, protocol, and closed states are false. *)

val shutdown_retryable : drain_failure -> bool
(** Returns [true] only when an activity adapter retained a completion after an
    explicitly transient native failure. Workflow drains and all permanent
    errors must leave a worker terminal rather than reopening it. *)

val needs_native_cleanup : drain_failure -> bool
(** Returns [true] when a failed drain must be followed by native graph
    disposal. Only the explicitly retryable activity case may leave the graph
    open for another completion attempt. *)

(** Runs a terminal cleanup while preserving the original adapter error. The
    boolean result is [true] when the cleanup callback returned either [Ok] or
    [Error]; both outcomes mean the native implementation reached its
    documented terminal-release path. It is [false] only when the callback
    raised before returning, in which case callers must retain adapter state
    and arrange a last-resort retry or finalizer path. A cleanup diagnostic is
    sent to [on_cleanup_error] rather than replacing the error that explains
    why the worker became terminal. [on_cleanup_exception] handles an
    unexpected cleanup exception for the same reason. *)
