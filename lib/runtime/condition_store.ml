(** Implements deterministic, workflow-local condition waits.

    Temporal conditions are deliberately a language-runtime feature rather
    than a server operation.  A false predicate retains one scheduler-owned
    future and one predicate callback; the activation loop calls [notify] after
    it has run the current batch of workflow jobs.  This keeps the operation
    replay-safe and avoids inventing a timer, command, history event, thread,
    or native lock merely to wait for an OCaml value to change. *)

(** The callback used to decide whether one waiter can be released. *)
type predicate = unit -> (bool, Temporal_base.Error.t) result

(** One registered predicate and its one-shot scheduler signal.  [active] is
    checked by every transition so a stale callback cannot resolve a future
    after shutdown or after an earlier notification already settled it. *)

    registration constant-time; [List.rev] is used only for FIFO notification
    and the small removal scans, keeping ordering explicit and deterministic. *)
