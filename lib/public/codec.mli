    [encode] function converts a value to bytes, and [decode] converts those
    bytes back to a value. The SDK writes [encoding] into the payload metadata
    and checks it before decoding, preventing the wrong codec from reading a
    payload.

    requirement; applications may define other codecs with [make]. *)

(** Encodes [()] as an empty [binary/null] payload. *)
val unit : unit t

(** Encodes [None] as [binary/null]. A [Some value] normally uses the supplied
    codec and keeps that codec's encoding name, preserving cross-SDK
    interoperability. When the inner codec would itself produce a [binary/null]
    payload — as [unit] and a nested [option]'s own [None] do — the [Some]
    value is wrapped in a distinct envelope so it can never be mistaken for
    [None] on decode. This makes the codec injective: [Some ()], [Some None],
    and [None] all round-trip to different values. Duplicate metadata names are
    rejected when decoding any representation.

    The wrapper is used only for the [binary/null]-shaped inner values above; it
    never appears for ordinary payloads such as [string option] or [int option],
    which keep the standard [binary/null]/inner-encoding representation that
    other-language SDKs already understand. If you instead want an option to
    collapse onto a foreign nullable — deliberately letting [Some ()] read as
    absent for a non-OCaml consumer — do not use this combinator; define that
    exact wire representation yourself with {!make}. *)
