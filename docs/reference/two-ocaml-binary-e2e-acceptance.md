# Two-OCaml-binary Temporal acceptance design

**Status:** The complete [PR #226 Actions run](https://github.com/mfow/ocaml-temporal/actions/runs/29224854182)
verified the ten scenarios against real Temporal Server and PostgreSQL for
PR head `ca112b8`, using the earlier timeout-fixture delay. This branch changes
that delay to outlive Temporal Core's local timeout buffer; live verification
of the ordering guard is pending. The earlier [PR #210 Actions run](https://github.com/mfow/ocaml-temporal/actions/runs/29221151859)
verified the previous nine scenarios; that PR used head `47c9a93` and was
squash-merged as `f877fbf`. The tenth `smoke.activity_timeout_retry` scenario
has a first activity callback that sleeps beyond its 500 ms start-to-close
timeout, and PR #226 accepted its exact second-attempt marker. The earlier run
covers fan-out, timer/activity,
ordinary activity retry, heartbeat-detail retry, parent/child success,
propagated child failure, child cancellation, a typed non-retryable workflow
failure, and marker-guarded exact-run cancellation. The retry workflow still
uses an explicit two-attempt policy, while the heartbeat workflow proves that
Temporal returns the first attempt's detail and timeout to the second attempt.
The worker and driver remain guarded by
`TEMPORAL_TWO_BINARY_LIVE=1`; only the dedicated Compose services set it.

The current implementation starts all ten top-level workflows before waiting
for any result, and its assertion target requires six exact successes, one
propagated child failure, one child-cancellation marker, one typed
non-retryable failure, and one exact-run cancellation. The previous nine
assertions are backed by the green PR #210 live run and were also exercised by
PR #226. The current timeout ordering still needs a fresh live run. Restart,
replay, cache eviction,
and asynchronous activity completion remain separate acceptance work.

The heartbeat assertion has a Docker-free contract in addition to the live
driver and worker. `test/smoke/test_temporal_heartbeat_contract.sh` checks the
source-level role boundary, registration, start-before-wait ordering, exact
retry result, and marker cleanup. The Docker-free
`test/smoke/test_temporal_activity_timeout_contract.sh` separately checks the
timeout-only activity's late first callback, short start-to-close lease,
worker registration, and exact second-attempt marker. The Dune test in
`test/integration/temporal/common/marker_test/test_smoke_definitions.ml` then
invokes the same context-aware activity callback with an in-memory context: it
checks the first typed heartbeat and retryable failure, copies the heartbeat
detail into a second attempt with the 500 ms timeout, requires the exact
success value, and proves that the completed first context rejects a later
heartbeat. These local checks are deliberately not described as Temporal
Server evidence; they make a missing registration, changed payload, lost
timeout, or context-lifetime regression fail before an expensive Compose run.

`temporal-start-worker` force-recreates the worker container before waiting, so
the readiness marker in the container's `/tmp` cannot be inherited from a
stopped container. `smoke-worker` then removes any prior readiness marker after
validating its readiness path and before later marker validation or public
`Temporal.Worker.create` begins. Once creation succeeds it publishes a new
atomic readiness marker. Compose waits for that health check before
`smoke-driver` is run. Each acceptance run starts after
`temporal-clean` has
removed the Compose project and its PostgreSQL data volume, and cleanup removes
that volume again on success or failure; no database state is preserved for a
later acceptance run. The driver starts all ten top-level workflows before
waiting for any result. The cancellation scenario waits for the
`smoke.cancellation_ready` activity marker after the long-running workflow has
issued its durable-timer and marker commands in one activation, then
acknowledges cancellation for `two-binary-long-running-cancellation` before
the first terminal wait. Six must complete with exact payloads, one must
propagate a typed child failure, one must return `SMOKE:CHILD:CANCELLED` after
child cancellation, one must return a typed non-retryable workflow failure,
and the cancelled execution
must return typed `Cancelled` metadata when the driver waits on that same exact
handle. The heartbeat scenario records a progress detail with a 500 ms timeout,
returns a retryable activity error, and requires the second attempt to receive
that detail and timeout through its activity context. This prevents a TCP
check or a process that merely started from being reported as an SDK
acceptance pass.

The public `Temporal.Client` and `Temporal.Worker` now route HTTP(S) calls
through the private Rust/Core supervisor. The deterministic `mock://` backend
remains available for unit tests. The worker's native poll, bounded readiness,
completion, and typed registration loop is covered by focused tests; the
Compose acceptance supplies the first real-server verification layer.

During teardown, the worker's small test-process control Domain translates
Compose's SIGTERM into `Temporal.Worker.shutdown`; the signal handler itself
only sets an atomic flag. The 30-second worker stop grace period gives the
bounded native waits time to leave their poll loop before the container is
removed. This is test-process lifecycle code, not a second worker supervisor.

The fixture starts the two public binaries after Temporal/PostgreSQL readiness
and asserts terminal workflow results while the worker executes registered
workflows and mock activities against the live server. This revision adds a
parent/child success case: the parent calls `Temporal.Child_workflow.execute`,
the registered child waits on a short durable timer, and the driver asserts the
parent's exact result. It also runs a child-failure parent that propagates a
deterministic non-retryable child error, and a child-cancellation parent that
uses `Child_workflow.start_handle` and `Wait_cancellation_requested` before
returning `SMOKE:CHILD:CANCELLED`. It also runs `smoke.activity_retry`: the first
`smoke.retry_once` attempt returns a retryable activity error and the second
returns `SMOKE:ATTEMPT:2`, which the driver compares as an exact terminal
payload. It also runs `smoke.activity_heartbeat_retry`: the first
`smoke.heartbeat_retry` attempt records `SMOKE:HEARTBEAT:PROGRESS:1` with a
500 ms heartbeat timeout, returns a retryable activity error, and the second
attempt must receive that detail and timeout before returning
`SMOKE:HEARTBEAT:RETRIED:SMOKE`. The driver also starts
`smoke.activity_timeout_retry`: its first `smoke.timeout_retry` callback sleeps
for 6 seconds while the activity's start-to-close timeout is 500 ms, then
returns a success that is intentionally too late. The second callback returns
`SMOKE:TIMEOUT:RETRIED:SMOKE`; the exact marker was accepted only after Temporal
has timed out the first lease and delivered the retry. The workflow disables
eager activity execution so this assertion crosses the normal worker
poll/completion path. Temporal Core adds a five-second local timeout buffer to
the 500ms server lease; the six-second delay gives Core time to classify the
expired token before the callback returns. Its source contract is Docker-free.
The earlier ten-run path passed in the [PR #226 live CI run](https://github.com/mfow/ocaml-temporal/actions/runs/29224854182),
but that run used the shorter delay; live evidence for this timeout-ordering
guard is pending. The driver also starts
`smoke.non_retryable_failure` and requires its
stable typed error metadata. It starts `smoke.long_running_cancellation`, waits
for its `smoke.cancellation_ready` marker activity (with eager execution
disabled), sends an exact-run cancellation request, and requires the same
handle to return a typed `Cancelled` error. This ten-run path passed in the
[PR #226 live CI run](https://github.com/mfow/ocaml-temporal/actions/runs/29224854182);
the historical nine-run path passed in [PR #210](https://github.com/mfow/ocaml-temporal/actions/runs/29221151859).
Heartbeat-timeout-triggered retries, child start failures,
activity asynchronous completion, replay, and worker recovery remain separate
scenarios. The
intentionally broader follow-up requirements are listed in [Required
assertions and failure evidence](#required-assertions-and-failure-evidence).

## Purpose

The first live acceptance test must prove more than that PostgreSQL and
Temporal Server accept connections. It must prove that two independently
started **OCaml executables**, both linked against the public `temporal-sdk`
library, can use the same Temporal namespace and task queue:

1. the **driver**, a one-shot OCaml test runner, starts more than one workflow,
   checks each expected terminal result, and exits nonzero for a failed
   assertion; and
2. the **worker** receives workflow and activity tasks, runs registered OCaml
   workflow and mock-activity implementations, and reports their completions
   through the private Rust/Core bridge.

The two roles are intentionally asymmetric. `smoke-driver` creates a
client-only SDK instance; it does not register a worker, poll tasks, or execute
workflow/activity implementations. `smoke-worker` is the long-lived Temporal
worker that performs those operations. The driver's assertions are the
acceptance oracle: a successful worker process alone is not a passing test.

The driver is not allowed to call Rust, Temporal's gRPC API, the Temporal CLI,
or a test-only service directly. The worker is not allowed to use test-only
activation injection. Both applications must use the installed public OCaml
library surface. Rust remains a private static-library implementation detail
of each executable.

This is deliberately a worker-SDK acceptance test, not merely a client
smoke test. A green result for the full current acceptance contract would mean
the complete path below was observed:

```

`R1` and `R2` are linked copies of the same project-owned Rust static library,
not a server or a sidecar. The two processes intentionally have independent
SDK instances and native resource graphs.

## Test topology and file ownership

All assets specific to this acceptance test belong below
`test/integration/temporal/`; the repository root keeps only Makefile entry
points. In particular, the Compose fixture belongs at
`test/integration/temporal/compose.yaml`, together with its Temporal Server
configuration and helper scripts. The OCaml executables and their Dune
definitions live under that same test subtree:

```text
test/integration/temporal/
├── compose.yaml
├── config/
├── scripts/
├── common/
│   ├── dune
│   └── smoke_definitions.ml
├── worker/
│   ├── dune
│   └── smoke_worker.ml
└── driver/
    ├── dune
    └── smoke_driver.ml
```

The acceptance topology includes `postgresql`, `temporal`, `smoke-worker`,
and `smoke-driver`. Compose also defines `temporal-schema` and
`temporal-admin-tools` for database initialization and diagnostics, plus the
shared `dev` image template. `smoke-worker` and `smoke-driver` use the same
development image and repository checkout, but execute different Dune
binaries. This proves that the public library can be linked into more than one
OCaml-owned binary; it does not imply that an application must share a Rust
runtime across processes. Each process uses its own absolute Dune build
directory
(`/workspace/_build/smoke-worker` or `/workspace/_build/smoke-driver`). Dune
keeps a build-directory lock for the lifetime of `dune exec`; separate
directories are therefore required while the worker is running, otherwise the
driver's build can wait forever on the worker's lock before its OCaml code
starts.

The worker health check becomes healthy only after `Temporal.Worker.create`
has connected, validated the native worker, and registered its OCaml
definitions. Startup first removes the marker from any interrupted or reused
container, then deliberately publishes readiness before `Worker.run` enters
the long-lived poll loop, so the Makefile can wait for a semantic readiness
marker rather than treating a bare process or TCP listener as readiness.
`temporal-start-worker` waits for that health check, and the subsequent
`temporal-run-driver` target deliberately uses `docker compose run --no-deps`;
the explicit Makefile ordering therefore launches exactly one driver after the
already-ready worker. The driver's exit status is authoritative for workflow
assertions; the complete integration target additionally requires the driver's
graceful client-shutdown marker and the current run's exact `worker-stopped`
marker. None of these acceptance signals may be replaced by a schema
migration, namespace
registration, TCP check, or a `temporal operator cluster health` check.

`make test-temporal-integration` owns the fixture lifecycle: create its
isolated Compose project, run the low-level lifecycle check, wait for the
worker health marker, wait for the driver's terminal exit status, collect the
worker logs on failure, then tear the project down. The explicit alias
`make test-temporal-two-binary` is provided for callers that want the focused
acceptance name. Native Windows and macOS jobs do not run this Linux Compose
acceptance test.

The one-shot driver has a bounded 300-second process timeout. This leaves
enough headroom for a temporary PostgreSQL checkpoint or other host I/O stall
without allowing a lost native request to consume the CI job's full timeout.
When the bound is reached, Compose sends `TERM` and waits a further 10 seconds
before sending `KILL`; `TEMPORAL_DRIVER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` can override the
default for unusually slow local machines.

## The two OCaml programs

### Worker executable

The worker is a normal OCaml application. Its configuration names one
namespace and one dedicated smoke task queue. Before calling `run`, it
registers these local definitions with the public SDK:

* `smoke.fan_out`: starts two mock activities before it awaits either one,
  uses `Future.all`, and returns the ordered combined result. The mock
  activity returns a value derived from its input, so the workflow cannot
  produce the asserted result without processing both activity completions.
* `smoke.timer_then_activity`: starts a short durable timer, awaits it, then
  starts and awaits a mock activity. Its result distinguishes this workflow
  from `smoke.fan_out` and proves timer resolution as well as workflow and
  activity task processing.
* `smoke.child_after_timer`: a child workflow that awaits a short durable timer
  and returns a deterministic result from its input. It owns the timer so the
  parent/child success path exercises a timer activation for the child run.
* `smoke.parent_awaits_child`: starts `smoke.child_after_timer` through
  `Temporal.Child_workflow.execute` and awaits its terminal value. The child
  identity is derived only from the parent input, so the command is stable on
  replay.
* `smoke.parent_awaits_failed_child`: starts
  `smoke.child_non_retryable_failure` through the same direct-style helper and
  intentionally propagates the child's non-retryable terminal error. The
  driver checks the public terminal `Workflow` category and retryability, not
  Core's verbose failure-info text. The parent-side child future uses the more
  specific `Child_workflow` category, which is covered by native worker tests.
  Core represents this case as a child wrapper with `retry_policy_not_set` plus
  a nested application failure whose `non_retryable` flag is true; the OCaml
  client must retain that nested flag rather than treating the wrapper's state
  as a retryable result.
* `smoke.parent_cancels_child`: retains a child handle, requests cancellation
  with `Wait_cancellation_requested`, and awaits the child future. It returns
  `SMOKE:CHILD:CANCELLED` only after the typed cancellation result arrives;
  the child itself waits on a long durable timer so natural completion cannot
  satisfy the assertion.
* `smoke.activity_retry`: schedules `smoke.retry_once` with a two-attempt
  `Temporal.Activity.Retry_policy`. The worker activity deliberately returns a
  retryable error on its first call and includes the successful attempt number
  in its second result, giving the driver a direct assertion that Temporal
  performed the retry.
* `smoke.long_running_cancellation`: waits on a deliberately long durable
  timer. The driver cancels the exact run while that timer is outstanding and
  later asserts the typed `Cancelled` category, `non_retryable=false`, and the
  stable cancellation message.
* `smoke.mock_transform`: the OCaml mock activity implementation used by the
  two activity-oriented workflows. It has no network or wall-clock dependency
  and returns a value wholly determined by its decoded input.
* `smoke.retry_once`: the test-only activity implementation used by
  `smoke.activity_retry`. Its process-local attempt counter is intentionally
  outside workflow code; a fresh worker process and fresh PostgreSQL stack are
  created for each acceptance run.

The fixture implements this shape with the concrete `smoke.fan_out`,
`smoke.timer_then_activity`, `smoke.activity_retry`,
`smoke.child_after_timer`, `smoke.parent_awaits_child`,
`smoke.child_non_retryable_failure`, `smoke.parent_awaits_failed_child`,
`smoke.child_long_running`, `smoke.parent_cancels_child`,
`smoke.non_retryable_failure`, `smoke.long_running_cancellation`,
`smoke.mock_transform`, `smoke.retry_once`, and `smoke.cancellation_ready`
definitions, all of which are registered by the long-lived public worker:

```ocaml
let () =
  match
    Temporal.Worker.create
      ~task_queue:"ocaml-temporal-two-binary-smoke"
      ~workflows:
        [ fan_out; timer_then_activity; activity_retry;
          activity_heartbeat_retry; child_after_timer; parent_awaits_child;
          child_non_retryable_failure; parent_awaits_failed_child;
          child_long_running; parent_cancels_child; non_retryable_failure;
          long_running_cancellation ]
      ~activities:
        [ mock_transform; retry_once_activity; heartbeat_retry_activity;
          cancellation_ready_activity ]
      ()
  with
  | Error error -> report_and_exit error
  | Ok worker -> Temporal.Worker.run worker |> report_and_exit
```

The important property is that these are OCaml functions registered by the
worker executable, rather than synthetic protocol fixtures or Rust test
handlers.

The workflow bodies obey normal replay rules: no process environment reads,
filesystem access, wall-clock reads, random values, mutable process-global
state, unordered collection iteration, or network I/O. Only SDK operations
create Temporal commands. The activity may do nondeterministic work in later
tests, but this first mock stays deterministic so result assertions remain
unambiguous.

### Driver executable

The driver is a one-shot OCaml acceptance-test executable. It creates a
client-only SDK instance and does **not** register a worker; the other
executable, `smoke-worker`, owns task polling and workflow/activity execution.
The driver must:

1. connect through `Temporal.Client` to the fixture namespace;
2. start `smoke.fan_out`, `smoke.timer_then_activity`,
   `smoke.activity_retry`, `smoke.activity_heartbeat_retry`,
   `smoke.activity_timeout_retry`,
   `smoke.parent_awaits_child`, `smoke.parent_awaits_failed_child`,
   `smoke.parent_cancels_child`, `smoke.non_retryable_failure`, and
   `smoke.long_running_cancellation` with distinct, known workflow IDs before
   it waits for any of them;
3. retain the ten public workflow handles returned by `start`;
4. call `Temporal.Client.cancel` on the exact long-running handle and require
   its positive acknowledgement before waiting for any terminal result;
5. wait for each handle's terminal result through the public client API; and
6. decode and compare the six successful results, require the child-failure
   result to be a typed non-retryable child-workflow failure, require the
   child-cancellation result to equal `SMOKE:CHILD:CANCELLED`, require the
   typed non-retryable workflow failure and exact-run `Cancelled` outcome with
   expected metadata, then exit zero only if every assertion succeeded.

Starting all ten executions before the first wait is material. It demonstrates
that a client can hold independent workflow handles while a control request is
issued for one exact run, and that the worker can service separate workflow
executions rather than passing a single serial request through a readiness-only
check. Workflow IDs are fixed and unique within the freshly created fixture
database, and run IDs returned by `start` are retained for exact result and
cancellation operations. Because the acceptance target recreates that database
for every run, it does not depend on a retained volume or on test-run suffixes.
Randomness in the driver is acceptable but randomness in a workflow is not.

The driver returns a nonzero status for connection, start, terminal workflow,
codec, timeout, or assertion failures. A workflow failure is an expected
typed result at the library boundary; it must not be represented by an
uncaught OCaml exception. Its diagnostic output is metadata-only: operation,
workflow ID, run ID when available, error kind, and latency. It must not print
payload bytes or bridge JSON.

## Required private bridge operations

The existing [private JSON control protocol](core-protocol.md) remains the
only OCaml/Rust data boundary. Rust is the only code that reads or writes
Temporal/Core protobuf. The following operation names are the minimal first
live slice; their bodies must be closed schemas and have Rust and OCaml
validators before an operation changes native or workflow state.

| Operation | Direction | Required result | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `client.connect` | OCaml to Rust | client-ready acknowledgement | Builds the connected Core client in the instance graph using endpoint, namespace, TLS, and identity configuration supplied at instance creation. |
| `client.start_workflow` | OCaml to Rust | exact `{workflow_id, run_id}` | Converts a typed OCaml input payload and start options into `StartWorkflowExecution`. |
| `client.wait_workflow_result` | OCaml to Rust | terminal completed payload, typed terminal failure, continued-as-new successor, or retryable `NOT_READY` | Performs a close-event long poll for that exact execution for at most 100 ms per call; the caller retries an open run without polling a worker task queue. |
| `worker.create` | OCaml to Rust | worker-ready acknowledgement | Creates and validates the Core worker for the configured namespace/task queue. |
| `worker.poll_workflow` | OCaml to Rust | one workflow activation or a terminal shutdown indication | Calls Core's workflow-activation poll and converts the returned protobuf to the existing semantic activation JSON. |
| `worker.complete_workflow` | OCaml to Rust | acknowledgement | Validates the existing semantic completion JSON, converts it to Core protobuf, and completes the activation. |
| `worker.poll_activity` | OCaml to Rust | one semantic activity task or a terminal shutdown indication | Calls Core's activity-task poll and converts task token, identity, headers, input payloads, attempt, and deadlines to JSON. |
| `worker.complete_activity` | OCaml to Rust | acknowledgement | Validates an OCaml activity result/failure/cancellation and completes exactly the supplied task token. |
| `worker.record_activity_heartbeat` | OCaml to Rust | acknowledgement | Validates copied heartbeat details and records progress for exactly the supplied leased activity task without completing or retiring its lease. |
| `worker.initiate_shutdown` | OCaml to Rust | acknowledgement | Stops admission and asks Core to begin graceful worker shutdown. |

The current activation/completion schema defines the workflow-side semantic
conversion for initialization, activity resolution, timer firing, cancellation,
eviction, activity scheduling, timers, and terminal commands. The closed
`activity-task` and `activity-completion` schemas are validated by both
language adapters, and the initial live slice connects them to the native
poll/completion loop. They represent only the information an OCaml activity
runner needs; raw `ActivityTask` protobuf bytes, raw pointers, and Core errors
are forbidden outside Rust. The first acceptance test uses the task token,
activity type, workflow/run identifiers, attempt, input payloads, and
completion variants needed for its mock activity. The heartbeat document and
`worker.record_activity_heartbeat` operation are now implemented with strict
bilateral validation and focused native tests, and the two-binary fixture
invokes them in its heartbeat-detail retry scenario. The PR #210 live run
verified detail and timeout delivery; heartbeat-timeout-triggered retry and
asynchronous-completion fields can be added as separate closed changes.

`client.start_workflow` accepts workflow type, workflow ID, task queue, and
typed input payloads. It returns the server-issued run ID. `client.wait_workflow_result`
accepts both workflow ID and that run ID, so a continued-as-new or a later run
with the same workflow ID cannot be confused with the started execution. Its
terminal response is a closed variant for completed result, failed execution,
cancelled execution, terminated execution, timed out execution,
continued-as-new execution (including the successor run ID), or a bridge
transport failure. An exact-run wait does not silently follow
continued-as-new: it returns that typed successor outcome so callers can
explicitly decide whether to await the new run. The public OCaml API keeps the
ten workflow results as typed workflow-result outcomes and reserves bridge
transport failure for `Error`.

The worker operations use `request`/terminal `response` or `error` envelopes
with ordinary correlations. A poll response carries an activation/task only
after Rust has copied it into a Rust-owned result buffer and both sides have
validated it. Completion input is copied and validated before Rust mutates
Core. Every output follows the existing validate, normalize, encode, strict
decode, and validate-again rule. Error messages are bounded, typed, and
payload-free.

## Pinned Temporal Core mapping

The Cargo lockfile pins Temporal Core to commit
`95e97686a079dcfe6c42e3254b2f3f5e3d97408f`. This design is tied to that
revision and must be rechecked when the pin changes.

Rust creates its Tokio/Core runtime once for an SDK instance. It connects a
`temporalio_client::Connection`, then constructs the worker with
`temporalio_sdk_core::init_worker`. Worker construction must run in that
runtime's entered Tokio context: the pinned implementation uses Tokio task
creation while it builds worker internals. `Worker::validate()` is awaited once
before any poll, as required by Core.

The relevant pinned Core contracts are:

* [`init_worker`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/blob/95e97686a079dcfe6c42e3254b2f3f5e3d97408f/crates/sdk-core/src/lib.rs)
  constructs a `Worker` from the Core runtime, worker configuration, and
  connection.
* [`Worker::poll_workflow_activation` and
  `Worker::complete_workflow_activation`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/blob/95e97686a079dcfe6c42e3254b2f3f5e3d97408f/crates/sdk-core/src/worker/mod.rs)
  are the workflow poll/complete pair. Core requires a response for every
  activation and forbids concurrent workflow polls on one worker; a missing
  completion can permanently stall that run.
* [`Worker::poll_activity_task` and
  `Worker::complete_activity_task`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/blob/95e97686a079dcfe6c42e3254b2f3f5e3d97408f/crates/sdk-core/src/worker/mod.rs)
  are the corresponding activity pair. Core forbids concurrent activity polls
  on one worker and allows activity completions concurrently.
* [`Worker::initiate_shutdown`, `shutdown`, and
  `finalize_shutdown`](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/blob/95e97686a079dcfe6c42e3254b2f3f5e3d97408f/crates/sdk-core/src/worker/mod.rs)
  require the language SDK to stop admitting work, drain polls until they
  report shutdown, complete outstanding tasks, and then release the worker.
* The client start path uses Rust's pinned Temporal client
  `StartWorkflowExecution` RPC; result waiting uses the corresponding
  history/close-event long-poll path. These protobuf details stay in Rust and
  are represented to OCaml only by the semantic JSON messages above.

The bridge must use the checked-in Core crates, not the upstream callback C
bridge. The upstream C bridge is useful only as behavior reference; this
project deliberately uses synchronous, owned-byte calls so arbitrary Rust
threads never invoke OCaml callbacks.

## Ownership, concurrency, and shutdown

One OCaml supervisor actor owns the whole Rust graph for each process: Tokio
runtime, connection/client, optional worker, native readiness primitive, and
shutdown coordination. The driver owns a graph with no worker; the worker owns
a graph with one worker for this acceptance test. There is no actor per client,
workflow handle, activation, activity task, or Rust handle.

The supervisor serializes graph creation and lifecycle transitions. Exact-run
history waits are close-event long polls with a 100 ms native deadline. A
timeout cancels the request and returns `NOT_READY`, so the owner Domain can
service shutdown or another lifecycle message before a caller or orchestration
loop retries the wait through the OCaml mailbox. Close first rejects new
operations, signals blocked polls, waits for any current bounded call and
outstanding OCaml workflow/activity work to reach a terminal state, then
destroys resources in reverse order:

```text
stop admission
  -> Worker.initiate_shutdown
  -> drain both poll loops and complete accepted work
  -> Worker.finalize_shutdown
  -> client/connection
  -> Core runtime and Tokio runtime
```

This separation preserves the one-owner graph without serializing long-lived
network operations behind a single mailbox. It also prevents a use-after-free:
native destruction cannot begin while a lease holds an `Arc` to the Rust
worker/client. Once shutdown starts, a later operation receives a typed
`Closed`/shutdown result, never a dangling handle.

There is exactly one in-flight `worker.poll_workflow` request and one
in-flight `worker.poll_activity` request per worker, because the pinned Core
contract forbids concurrent polls of either type. Workflow and activity
completion calls may overlap in Rust, but each must carry a one-shot operation
correlation and an exact activation run ID or activity task token. Rust keeps a
bounded outstanding-work ledger:

* add a workflow entry only after a successful poll response is committed;
* remove it only after its one accepted completion reaches a terminal Core
  response;
* reject duplicate, unknown, or post-shutdown completions before Core;
* apply the analogous rule to activity task tokens; and
* turn malformed JSON, conversion failures, and OCaml workflow defects into a
  valid failure completion whenever Core still expects a response.

This ledger is bridge-owned state guarded by one Rust mutex/actor and is not
an OCaml hash table shared across Domains. Its purpose is correctness and
bounded lifetime accounting, not scheduling. The OCaml workflow runtime keeps
its own deterministic execution state per Temporal run and never shares it
between executions.

C stubs release the OCaml runtime lock for a blocking bridge call. They copy
returned Rust bytes into OCaml-managed memory before freeing the Rust result
buffer. Rust threads signal only the native readiness primitive; they never
call an OCaml closure. Consequently a long client result wait or worker poll
cannot block an OCaml workflow effect scheduler or run OCaml code on a Tokio
thread.

## Required assertions and failure evidence

The prior driver's successful exit established all of the following against
the live stack. These assertions passed in the complete [PR #210 Actions run](https://github.com/mfow/ocaml-temporal/actions/runs/29221151859)
for PR head `47c9a93`, later squash-merged as `f877fbf`:

1. each top-level workflow start returned a nonempty run ID that the driver
   retained for its corresponding exact-run wait; the driver starts nine
   distinct top-level runs before its first wait;
2. the driver observes the atomically published
   `SMOKE_CANCELLATION_READY_FILE` marker containing the current run token,
   proving the timer and marker commands were accepted before cancellation;
3. the cancellation request names the long-running workflow's exact retained
   workflow ID and run ID, and Temporal acknowledges it before the driver waits;
4. all nine terminal waits matched the exact workflow ID and run ID returned by
   their own starts;
5. `smoke.fan_out` returned the ordered result requiring both mock activity
   completions;
6. `smoke.timer_then_activity` returned its expected result after a durable
   timer and its mock activity completion;
7. `smoke.activity_retry` returned `SMOKE:ATTEMPT:2` only after its first
   activity attempt failed and Temporal scheduled the second attempt;
8. `smoke.activity_heartbeat_retry` recorded one typed progress detail with a
   500 ms heartbeat timeout, then returned `SMOKE:HEARTBEAT:RETRIED:SMOKE` only
   after the retrying attempt received that detail and timeout. The local
   heartbeat contract also checks the encoded detail, retryable first failure,
   worker/driver registration boundary, and post-completion context
   invalidation before any live claim is made;
9. `smoke.parent_awaits_child` returned `SMOKE:CHILD` only after its child
   completed its own durable timer;
10. `smoke.parent_awaits_failed_child` returned a non-retryable `Workflow`
    failure. The assertion does not depend on Core's version-specific child
    diagnostic wording; the more specific `Child_workflow` category is tested
    inside the parent workflow when its child future resolves;
11. `smoke.parent_cancels_child` returned `SMOKE:CHILD:CANCELLED` only after
    Core resolved the child cancellation;
12. the five success responses were not workflow failures, cancellations,
   timeouts, terminations, continued-as-new outcomes, codec failures, or
   bridge failures; and
13. `smoke.non_retryable_failure` returned a `Workflow` error with
   `non_retryable=true` and the stable intentional-failure message prefix; and
14. `smoke.long_running_cancellation` returned a `Cancelled` error with
   `non_retryable=false` and the stable message `workflow execution was
    cancelled`.

The current fixture keeps all fourteen historical assertions and adds
`smoke.activity_timeout_retry` as a tenth start and wait. The exact
`SMOKE:TIMEOUT:RETRIED:SMOKE` result was accepted in the PR #226 live Compose
run with the shorter delay; the historical PR #210 evidence above remains
limited to its nine runs, and this branch's ordering guard is pending live
verification.

The driver logs no-payload phase records for starts, exact-run cancellation,
exact-run waits, terminal classes, and operation latency. The Makefile requires
the driver's `client_shutdown status=ok` marker, and after that stops the
worker and requires the current run's exact `worker-stopped` marker. The
`two-binary worker stopped cleanly` line remains useful human-readable
diagnostic output, but aggregated Compose logs are not used as the teardown
oracle because they can include output from an earlier container instance. The
harness captures these records only for failure diagnosis; result assertions,
not log text, are the workflow success oracle. Per-activation/task identifiers
and completion latency are a future observability enhancement and must remain
payload-free if added.

The first live test is intentionally small. With this success path verified,
extend the same two-binary topology rather than adding a separate pseudo-worker
test:

* heartbeat-timeout-triggered retry, asynchronous activity completion, and
  activity-level non-retryable classification (the heartbeat-detail retry path
  is live-verified, while these additional activity capabilities remain open);
* multiple concurrent activities with `Future.all`, `race`, and cancellation;
* child workflow start failure, cancellation, retry policy, and non-success
  terminal handling through the worker;
* worker restart, replay, sticky-cache eviction, and continued execution; and
* cancellation of child/activity work and graceful shutdown while multiple
  executions are outstanding.

Child-start commands and both child-resolution jobs have a closed bilateral
schema, Core conversion, pure-OCaml lifecycle tests, and the PR #210
real-server assertions for parent/child success, propagated child failure, and
child cancellation. The activity retry policy has the same separation:
bilateral policy validation is synthetic, while the PR #210 run makes both the
ordinary attempt-2 result and heartbeat-detail retry live evidence; the PR #226
run adds start-to-close timeout-triggered retry for the earlier delay. The
updated timeout ordering remains pending a fresh live run. None of these
assertions claims coverage of heartbeat timeouts, replay, or recovery behavior.

## Completion criteria for this design

The previous nine-workflow acceptance contract was verified by the complete
[PR #210 CI run](https://github.com/mfow/ocaml-temporal/actions/runs/29221151859)
for PR head `47c9a93` before the squash merge as `f877fbf`. The current
ten-workflow contract below was verified by the complete [PR #226 CI run](https://github.com/mfow/ocaml-temporal/actions/runs/29224854182)
for PR head `ca112b8` before this timeout-ordering guard was added. A fresh
live run is required before treating the updated timing as verified:

* the nested Compose fixture starts real PostgreSQL and Temporal Server;
* it builds two separate OCaml executables that both link `temporal-sdk`;
* the worker's live Core poll/complete loops execute the registered OCaml
  workflow and mock activity code;
* the driver starts all ten top-level workflows through `temporal-sdk`, sends
  an exact-run cancellation request, waits for their results through
  `temporal-sdk`, and performs the listed success, typed-failure, and
  cancellation assertions;
* the fixture exits nonzero for a failed driver assertion, a workflow failure,
  a worker crash, or a cleanup timeout; and
* the focused test plus the normal Makefile verification and dependency
  quality gates pass for this change.

Passing infrastructure readiness alone remains insufficient evidence. The
success criteria above do not claim live coverage for the follow-up scenarios
listed earlier in this document.
