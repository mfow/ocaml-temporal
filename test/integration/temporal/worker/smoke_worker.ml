(** Worker process for the two-OCaml-binary live acceptance test.

    The worker registers the same shared workflow definitions as the driver,
    including the context-aware heartbeat/retry, timeout-triggered-retry,
    heartbeat-timeout-triggered-retry, and activity-level non-retryable
    scenarios, and keeps the public native
    worker loop alive until graceful shutdown. The executable remains
    guarded by [TEMPORAL_TWO_BINARY_LIVE] so a local run cannot accidentally
    connect to a developer's Temporal endpoint; the Compose job is the only
    place that enables the live gate. *)
